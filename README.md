# Lamp

Lamp is a project I have been working on for the last three months. Lamp is a CRM for internet
service providers (ISP).  ISP have always struggled with billing clients and communicating with them. 
Lamp has Daraja Api integrated to enable mpesa payment and billing clients. Lamp enables ISP to reach out to their customers through the Tiara SMS gateway. 
The need to connect with customers has been satisfied and now another need for ISP to manage their operations is yet to be fullfilled but that's taken care for by Lamp ERP module.
